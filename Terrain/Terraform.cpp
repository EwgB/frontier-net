  This module is a set of worker functions for Region.cpp.  Really, everything
  here could go in Region.cpp, except that region.cpp would be just too 
  damn big and unmanageable. 

  Still, this system isn't connected to anything else and it's only used
  when region.cpp is generating region data.
